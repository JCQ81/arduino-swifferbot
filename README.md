* 1x Toggle Switch
* 1x Battery case - 2slot AA
* Programming board for the Arduino Pro Mini *(*1)*
* Soldering equipment
* Wires
* Glue
* 3D printer
* Swiffer cloths

**1: There are several solutions, like using another arduino with an USB interface like the R3 or Nano, or use an interface like the CP2102 wich I preferred (don't forget to also order your dupont cables)*
